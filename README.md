## üí° Approach Taken

-   **Framework:** Built with **Next.js (Pages Router)** to leverage its powerful file-based routing, dynamic routing capabilities, and built-in API routes for the mock backend.
-   **State Management:**
    -   **Local State:** Utilized React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) for managing state within individual components (e.g., form inputs, search queries).
    -   **Global State:** Implemented the **React Context API** to manage application-wide state for Theme (light/dark mode) and Authentication (login status). This provides a clean and scalable solution without prop-drilling.
-   **Styling:**
    -   Styled with **Global CSS and CSS Modules** for a combination of a consistent theme and component-scoped styles.
    -   A theme was established using **CSS Variables**, allowing for an easy and efficient implementation of the light/dark mode switcher.
    -   The design is fully responsive for mobile, tablet, and desktop, with a focus on a modern aesthetic.
-   **User Experience:** Enhanced with a persistent light/dark theme, session persistence using `localStorage`, and dynamic hover/transition effects to create an engaging and user-friendly interface.
